# Java-OOP-Lab-Camp-Bunk-Camper-Management
Overview This Java project demonstrates OOP fundamentals by modeling a camp's bunk and camper management system. It includes `Bunk` and `Camper` classes, with a driver program to calculate weekly fees and display mail labels. The project focuses on encapsulation, "has-a" relationships, and Javadoc documentation for each component.
